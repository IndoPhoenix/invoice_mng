## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (for local development) or a MongoDB Atlas account for cloud database

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
